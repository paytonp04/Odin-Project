    <h1>What I Learned</h1>
    <p>This is the Odin Project checkpoint for HTML Foundations. In this portion of the course, the basic creation of a website was addressed, including boilerplate, the importance of an index file, different elements and tags to put in a site, reference and outside links, and how to use github in development</p>
    <p>In the checkpoint, I was able to implement images, unordered and ordered lists, headers, boilerplates, index files, reference links, and github.</p>
